I'm just over two months into learn, so I figured I'd give a rundown of daily life. Before I started the program I aspired to be consumed by it. I wanted to have hours on end of motivation where I would dig into the subject material, and gain a deep understanding of said material. I however know myself, and know that achieving that level of focus and motivation would be a challenge. I also knew that keeping a balanced schedule would also be important. 

Sitting in an uncomfortable chair all day will wreck havoc on ones body. Creating a daily workout routine was important to me to help me keep motivated. IMO daily workout is an excellent source to start balancing out learning to program. It's also a great stress reliever. There have been many times I would be completely frustrated by something I couldn't figure out. Lifting some weights, going for a run, or going for a swim washes much of the stress away. Also taking an ice cold shower after a workout really invigorates me, and gets me ready to jump back into coding. 

As I write this blog post at 1 in morning, I am reminded that a good daily sleep schedule is perhaps the most important factor in attaining an optimal study/work flow. My former lifestyle of a professional poker player doesn't make this step easy. A lot of poker life takes place at night. And there's no requirement to wake up early, so sleeping in, and going to bed late are the norm. For a while I was on a good sleep schedule, waking up early, going to bed early, and getting a good days work in. Inevitably the cycle was disrupted by something or another. I decided that forcing myself to wake up early wasn't productive. It lead to slow moving days, with little motivation. I decided that as long as I got an adequate number of hours of sleep, and I woke up feeling refreshed and ready to work, that's good enough. The ultimate goal is to have a "normal" sleep schedule, but the important thing is to get 6-8 hours of sleep.

I know I've grown as a coder! I find myself constantly thinking about code. I'm finding it easier to form code in my head, and know what it's going to do. It's a cool thing to realize. When I started I was worried I wasn't right for the coding world, and that I wouldn't be able to adjust my thinking. As I find myself thinking more and more about code, I am hopeful and excited as to what I'll know and be able to do a couple months from now, and then even a couple years from now. It's an exciting concept that I'm changing the course of my whole life.
