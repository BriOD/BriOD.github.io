The rails portfolio project for the [learn.co](http://learn.co) curriculum marks the 70% completion of the course. Couple that with the new year looming, I've been thinking a lot about my future as a programmer. I'm eager to continue learning, and expand on what I've already learned. All in all it's an exciting prospect.

My rails portfolio project gave me a good sense of building something from scratch, and claiming it as my own. It's something that I feel like I could deploy and maintain. I build an app that one can use to build and edit a menu for a restaurant. I build this with a specific friend in mind. My friend is in the process of opening up a restaurant, and any good restaurant need a good website. Most websites for restaurants are lame static websites that are difficult to edit for the owner.

I wanted to build something with the restaurant owner in mind. The owner can create and edit custom menus through simple forms. I also added a ratings class off all the items on the menu. This I think is very valuable because it offers direct feedback from customers. The owner can see what's popular and what not, what works and what doesn't. Let's say the owner wants to update the website with that days specials, or change the price of an item; it's as simple as a couple simple clicks. Most owners would be at the mercy of whatever cookie cutter website service they have, which could be very confusing to someone that doesn't know anything about programming. 

I have a different friend that also has his own restaurant, and he has a website through one of the aforementioned cookie cutter factory website providers(CCFWP). I was playing poker with him one night, and I had my computer with me in case I had the opportunity to study. He saw me on my computer working on my sinatra project, and he quickly started asking me about web development. He badly wanted to change the layout of his website. It took him 10 minutes just to figure out his password for his CCFWP. He initially paid them to set it up, gave them some basic info, and that was pretty much it. He was hopeless and clueless.

I think my rails app would be very useful to someone like him. It would encourage him to update his website daily, he would just need to remember his password. All he would have to do is login, his account would be an administrator, with the power to CRUD all the data on the website. 

My goal with this project is to continue developing it, and eventually put it into deployment for my friend. While the backend works fine, the front end leave much to be desired. One of my goals in the next couple of weeks is to drastically improve my styling capabilities. I want to be proud of the things I'm building, and no matter how fancy the backend is, no one likes an ugly website. I'm looking forward to the next section of the curriculum, which is JavaScript. I know very little about JS, and have always seen it as a mandatory requirement for devs. While I love ruby, I think it'll be nice to take a little break and learn something else for a little while. I'm intrigued to see how my knowledge of Ruby witll translate into understanding of a different language.
