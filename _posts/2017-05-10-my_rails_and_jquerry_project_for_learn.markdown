Leading up to my jQuerry project I had been reading "So Good They Can't Ignore You" by Cal Newport. As I am getting to the end of the learn curriculum I have been thinking a lot about entering the job market. I don't think it needs to be said, but I'll say it anyway, imposter syndrome has been creeping into all parts of my head. I know I have learned so much since starting learn, but at the same time I wory that I don't know enough.  "So Good They Can't Ignore You" focuses on how people find work they love, and how they become masters of their field. One of the main points Newport makes is that in order to reach a level of mastery, you have to be wiling to do deliberate practice. This means that you have to dig into the trenches and do the tedious, confusing, maddening work in order to improve. With all this fresh in my mind I set off to do my jQuerry project.

What a lot of people do for the project is they just add jQuerry to their existing rails project. But because I want to focus on doing the deliberate work, I decided I wanted to take in the practice and create a whole new rails project, and then add jQuerry to that. Not only did I want to create a new rails project, I wanted to dive deeper into programming that I hadn't touched on in my first rails project. Mainly I wanted to explore two new things. First I wanted to make sure there were tests for my application. There's a high emphasis on test driven development at flatiron, but it's not a requirement. I made it a requirement for myself. I know how important TDD is, I want to be sure I know how to do it. The second aspect I wanted to explore was adding a theme to my app. My first rails project leave much to be desired in terms of looking at it. I wanted to implement some bootstrap, and expand my practice with using HTML/CSS styling. I had originally attempted this in my first project, but gave up on it after little effort. I am actually disappointed bcause it turns out it was a lot easier than I thought. My app may not be the pretiest, but I feel proud that it looks presentable. 

A lot of the time the hardest part of creating a new app is coming up with an idea of what to build. This part came easily to me thatnks to Ryan Holiday and Tim Ferriss. I was listening to an episode of Tims podcast where Ryan was the gues, and Ryan was talking about his morning routine. He says that every morning he journals about what he did the day before. He holds hmself accountable for things that are important to him, such as if he practiced doing a certain amount of "deep work" on whatever he may be working on. This gave me the idea of creating an "Accountability Journal". 

What you do is create your daily activities, things that are important to you, tings that will ideally improve your life. You may want to exercise everyday, so you create a daily activity of exercise. When you create a new entry, you reflect on each of your individual daily activities, and you state if you completed it or not, for how long, and then any extra notes or thoughts you have.
