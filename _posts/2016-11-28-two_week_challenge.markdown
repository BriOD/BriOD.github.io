I’ve had a busy, distracting November. There was thanksgiving. I had a poker trip. The election was very distracting, and depressing. The point is that I’ve been distracted from programming. In the next two weeks I want to make up some of the programming time I lost due to these distractions, and regain a high level of focus.

In the poker world it’s common place for people to make [“prop bets”](https://theringer.com/jason-mercier-world-series-of-poker-three-bracelets-309f6886491a#.c5xpqkenn) on personal performance. For instance, a player will declare a challenge, stating they will make x amount profit over y amount of time under specific conditions. The challenge is issued, and then anyone that doesn’t think they can do it can bet against them. A good example would be a $10k profit in one month, playing $2/5 cash games. 

When you break this challenge down, the incentive for the player is purely to develop motivation. In the larger scheme of things, the player has a certain hourly rate, so completing the challenge just comes down to putting in the hours, and being consistent. If the player has a $50 hourly rate, it’ll take 200 hours. 

In a world driven by self motivation, the prop bets are a way of motivating people to work. In the process also holding yourself accountable, and forcing yourself to stay consistent. It’s easy enough to put in 200 hours, but putting in 200 quality hours is a different story. 

I want to emulate the benefits of prop bets, and point it towards programming. To make up for a lack of focus the last couple week, I want to challenge myself to do 100 hours of programming over the next two weeks. I’m not going to betting anyone that I can or cannot complete this challenge. By blogging about it, and putting it out there, I will be holding myself accountable to complete it. 

I don’t just want 100 hours of programming, I want 100 hours of quality programming. There’s a couple things I want to achieve during the 2 weeks: 
1) I want to complete the rails section on learn.co, I’m currently a little over 60% done with the section. 
2)  I want to record a video walkthrough of a lab, this is something I took a quick attempt at doing, and never came back to. 
3) I want to post three blog posts, the results of this challeng being one of them.  
4) I want to attend two meet ups.

This challenge will start tomorrow, Monday Nov 8th. Whether I accomplish everything or not I will post a blog about the experience at the end of the two weeks. I will have to make a couple personal sacrifices to complete this challenge. I have aquired some bad habits over the last couple weeks. I can't make light of how much the election has affected me, and introduced bad habits that take away from programming. I hope to achieve a high level of focus, and learn a lot. One way or the other it will be a very productive two weeks!
