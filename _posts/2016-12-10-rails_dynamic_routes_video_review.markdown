I wanted to make a video review of a learn.co lab for a while now. I originally had the idea right after I completed the lab. I always wonder how certain labs are "supposed" to be done. Often times when I look at a solution, and it differs from my own code. 

I chose this lab because it was the first lab in the rails section that doesn't hold your hand and walk you through. At this point, the lab seems very simple to me, I didn't learn anything going back over this lab, at least not anything about rails. I did learn about crappy sound quality, and other small technical difficulties. For some reason I couldn't reclone the lab and have things work. I would try and run rspec, and for whatever reason, it just wouldn't run. This is what caused me to stop the first time trying to do this. My solution was to just do the lab without running rspec, and just using rails s to show the work I was doing.

Like I said the sound quality is pretty bad, I don't have any professional equipment. I think the humming noise comes from my computers fan. I also notice myself mumbling a little, I forget that I'm talking to a video, and not to myself. I plan to make more videos like this, and improve on my video lecturing skills.
