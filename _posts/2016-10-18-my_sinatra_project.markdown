The Sinatra section of the learn.co curriculum has thus far been my favorite. It's made me feel like a real programmer. For the first time I had ideas in my head, and now a way to put them out into the world if I were so inclined to do so.

For my project I decided to mix two avenues of my life. I created a poker cash game sessions tracker. It allows you to enter information about a session, and it then stores it in the database, and displays the info on the web.  It's especially cool because it's something that I have practical use for, and I know plenty of people that would also get use out of it. 

Compared to the the CLI gem project, this was much easier for me. I knew what I was doing the whole way through. That alone gives me heaps of confidence, and optimistic about rails and the rest of the course.

There's still some minor tweaks I have to figure out, and some layout issues I want to get straight. This part is relatable to things you see on TV or in the movies. They always throw around terms like beta testing, and now I feel like I'm testing my own app, and upgrading the small things that I notice along the way.
