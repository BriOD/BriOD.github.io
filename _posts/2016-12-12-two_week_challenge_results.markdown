My [two week challenge](http://www.brianod.com/2016/11/28/two_week_challenge/) is over , and the result is pretty good. I reached 100 hours (well maybe a little short), I made a lot of progress in the rails section, and most importantly I re-focused all my attention on coding. 

There were some negative sides to this challenge, and I’ll expose them first since the good far outweighs the bad.  The bad was basically a quality vs. quantity dilemma. There were plenty of times when I was working just for the sake of putting hours in, and not really attaining optimal learning. One important lesson I learned is that I achieve a much more optimal working experience when I have task oriented goals, opposed to putting hours in. It's easier to achieve a flow state when working on one task. I would accidentally work for 5 hours without realizing it, I'd realize it when I tried to stand up. I found myself sacrificing positive habits in order to put in hours. Things like going to the gym, or meditating. My thought process would look something like this: "If I go to the gym, work out, go get lunch, come home, shower, I'll kill 2-3 hours where I could be working. Maybe I'll just go later tonight." As you can guess, I never went later that night.

Now let’s talk about the good. The main goal was to put in 100 hours. I accomplished that, kinda. My records show that I put in 100 hours, but to be honest, there were days where I worked 4.5 hours, and i rounded up to 5 hours. There were also days where I wasn’t exactly sure what time I started, so I just ballparked the start time. However, I didn’t account lunch breaks or any breaks towards the total.

| **TOTAL**  | **100**  |

I had a goal of completing the rails section. I didn't accomplish this, as I underestimated the difficulty of some of the labs, and overestimated my own ability. I did make excellent progress though. After 1 week I was 95% done. Right now all I left to complete the section is [the Flatiron BnB Methods Lab](https://learn.co/tracks/full-stack-web-development/rails/associations-and-rails/flatiron-bnb-methods-lab) (which is considered by many to be the hardest lab in the curriculum), and the rails portfolio project, which I have been brainstorming on for a while now. There are some things that I want to solidify before proceeding to fully dive into the portfolio project, so I hope to devote my full attention to this by the middle of the week.

I wanted to write three blog posts, this counting as one of them. This goal I came up a little short on. I wrote two, and have been working on the third one for a couple of days. I'm ok with not having completed it. I rather do it right than do it fast. It's a blog post all about rails forms, so look out for that one. 

I wanted to attend two meet ups. I ended up only getting to one. I went to [Digital Oceans](https://www.digitalocean.com/) in NYC who hosted a meetup run by [Redis Labs](https://redislabs.com/). It was a cool experience, but I was a little out of my depths. I understood about half of what the the guest lecturer was talking about. And that's not to say he didn't do a good job, he did a great job, it's just a lack of my own knowledge on the subject of high level databases. I did win a raffle!!!! Unfortunately I was the last winner, so the conselation prize was a woman’s heroine scarf(the only item left, the one no one else wanted). I'm sure my mom will love her stocking stuffer!!!

The important things I take away from the past two weeks are:
1. That task oriented goals provide a much more optimal working experience. 
2. Daily routines that improve mental clarity, such as working out and meditating, help improve focus. This seems obvious, but it's something that can very easily be neglected. 
3. I learned a new way to watch video lectures. I used to just watch the videos a couple times until I felt like I understood the material. In prepping for the blog post I want to write about forms, I rewatched the videos on forms, and diligently took notes. This made me see some gaps in knowledge I had about the subject. It's something that I can't believe I haven't been doing all along. 


One more essential tip I can give is to identify and eliminate, or at least minimize, distractions. Social media can be a **GIANT** useless time blackhole distraction. When I started this whole thing I signed out of my facebook and twitter accounts, deleted them from my ipad, and didn't think twice about it. I went a couple of days before I was bored one night and took a look. Guess what? I didn't miss anything. Anyway, the last two week shave been very productive, and I'm very happy about that. I'm looking forward to finishing off the year strong, and starting a new year full of programming. Now I'm off to the gym before I get back to the Flatiron BnB Methods Lab.
